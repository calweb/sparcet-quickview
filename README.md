# Sparcet Quickview
This is a simple little chrome extension mainly on here to help people provide a base of code to work with if they are curious on how to make a chrome extension, but also for anyone using the [Sparcet](http://www.sparcet.com) application.
## Options
Like many chrome extensions, there are a few options for this plugin.  If you actually use Sparcet, you can change it to the name of your company as it appears in the url -

* http://`yourcompany`.sparcet.com  (defaults to http://sparc.sparcet.com)
* You can also change how many individual sparcets you want listed in the popout window (max <= 40, but defaults to 15)

## Creating the extension from this code

You simply need to be in Google Chrome and go to from the wrench icon to > Settings > Extensions

Then check the box for Developer Mode in the top right, which will then allow you to `Load Unpacked Extension` or `Pack Extension`
